SLAM

You can run the simulation by running simulator.m file, and edit map.txt for changing the number and the position of landmarks.

Simulation will draw a plot for every iteration.
Red square and the line is the robot and its path.
Blue circles are the position of the actual landmarks.
Green stars are estimated position of the landmarks.
